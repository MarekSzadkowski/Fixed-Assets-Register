Works with Excel files where data is stored.

The workbook I was given had following 16 columns:<br>
###### ordinal number:
    it represents an invoice or a group of them,
    may repeat itself many times,
    may also be skipped (None), **AFTER** it has been specified once.
###### unused here<br>
###### inventory number<br>
###### financial source
    probably the most important column in the workbook,
    as it constitutes the fields of psp and cost_center.
###### invoice number<br>
###### invoice date<br>
###### name of a product/asset<br>
###### quantity
    uusally 1
